# Tree Simulator

## Summary

Tree Simulator is a relaxing and interactive game where players select and grow trees over time. The game features a dual leveling system: one for the player and one for individual trees, with progression based on time spent in the game.

This is an open source game made with Godot game engine, build by 2 indie noob developers with a lot of free time, with the objective to learn how to make game, and having fun.

- Idle Growth – Trees gain XP as long as the game is running;
- Settings Menu – Customize language, fullscreen mode, and more;
