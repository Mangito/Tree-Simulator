## Summary

**Tree Simulator** is a relaxing and fun game where you can grow and manage different types of trees. Start with a basic tree and earn money as it levels up. Use your earnings to unlock new and unique tree species. Once your trees reach their maximum level, they begin to drop fruits, which you can collect and convert into more money. Progress through levels, expand your tree collection, and enjoy a peaceful simulation experience!
